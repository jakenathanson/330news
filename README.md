Creative Portion
Change account info:

We added an "Account" portal so users can change their username, password, and associated email address. Passwords are hashed and sent securely to the SQL database.

Share/save stories (see screenshots):

Once logged in, users can click "Save for later" (which emails the appropriate story to them if address is available) or "Share" (which redirects to a form that accepts valid email addresses and send the story there).

Notes
New users (e.g. TAs) can create accounts by following the "Register" link at the top-right corner of the page
The share/save feature is often inhibited by email server spam filters; we've found that Gmail, in particular, sends emails like ours to the spam folder. Other email services don't deliver them at all. YMMV.
